5,Soso & Sans,Daniel V.,1.0,29/10/2018,"I was sitting a few days ago at the Soso & Sans branch in Rishon Lezion. Must say I really enjoyed it, the food came really really fast, hot and the meat very high quality. The staff were lovely and helped me choose a dish that suited me. I took a burger with toppings on top and mashed potatoes as a side dish. The food was very tasty: both the hamburger and the side dish and exceeded my expectations much more than the hamburger restaurants I ate at in the past .. It is important to say that the atmosphere was really good, the music working and the appearance of the place was clean and tidy. Highly recommend, I will definitely be back again.",5.0
6,Soso & Sans,LED K.,10.0,30/04/2021,We were 4. I ordered a double with a regular eye egg. I got the opposite. The meatballs of us all were dry. One had a piece of non-chewable rubber. My bun was tired. The vegan burger was a pile of pieces that fell apart and fell off the bun. The chips were the only bright spot - delicious and hot. The chips were sold separately at a price of 16 NIS per unit. The trigger in front of the order counter was sticky and the shoes stuck to the soles of the shoes. The toilets were filthy! Puddles of urine and no toilet paper. Crazy price and the value is simple on the face! So disappointing. My first and last time at the place.,1.0

My name is Mulalin Mengistu must say that the adult is so sick and pale and people are not ashamed to call themselves one team one there sick because the adult in short the adult is similar to the science teacher in Zipper compared to the branch in Tel Aviv that the adult at Gal Gadot and Bar Refaeli depends on what you ordered,5.0

I have been waiting for over an hour and a half for food and nothing is happening. I talked to a salesman from the branch, the only thing he ""pinked"" me was free chips.

The other waiters didn’t seem to know the menu and had no idea what kind of sauce/side dishes they had. Felt like they forgot about us the entire service. Let’s just say you won’t be going there for the service. The food was amazing! The place has a pretty simplen concept- beer and meat. They served the beers that you don’t usually find everywhere and were great. We were 4 people so we ordered for starters Pilmeni (a bit too oily), shrimp carbonara x 2 and yellowtail carpaccio. For main courses, we had shrimp linguine, spareribs and sirloin. The meat dishes arrive with mashed potato/fries/salad. The sirloin wasn’t seasoned almost but was a perfect cut and cooked perfectly too and arrived with a buttery mashed potato. For dessert, we had bread pudding that came with a vanilla ice cream and 2 dishes of creme brûlée. The creme brûlée was dull and tasteless",5.0

In addition, a crowded and filthy place. I chose what I wanted to order instead of taking an invitation and leaving the friends to their own devices he said ""you are not the problem here"" as if the rest were problematic for him. Then he repeated about six or seven times that they did not change anything and were not ready like that and were not ready for it. Browse the menu. Beyond that if you are as an algorithm why is the place so filthy a b in food it is not cleanliness and hygiene?

When we wanted to browse a bit on the menu he said and I quote ""I'm coming back in just a minute with a jug of water and 3 glasses"" in a way that really reminded me of dark regimes. We just got up and left and when he saw it he did not ask why but just said ""this is the best hamburger in the country"" Every McDonald's branch is worth more with a smile than such a restaurant in Bad Waves.

And the food ... just wow !!! We were insanely surprised that a pair of non-vegans could enjoy so much in a vegan restaurant, just every dish we ordered was above and beyond expected, even the chips were level above any other chips !!!

We ate three dishes that were each larger, more pampering, special and original than the other. I wish we had room for more food. The main courses are really huge and satisfying.

I couldn't believe it, a place that honor himself would do it immediately without even asking, the waiter said ""we can't return it, you can choose something else but no cancellation"" I didn't leave just hungry but hungry and angry.. eventually we paid 180₪ for 1 dish.. shame on them..

For example I ordered a goulash with potatoes for NIS 69 per serving, the potatoes were reasonable but the meat was fibrous and inedible probably they used cheap meat. For dessert, I ordered a placenta gondola and received a tiny lynx that is far from a dish for 29 shekels. For a drink I ordered a bottle of soda with a back of 24 shekels.

Turns out they have a cheeseburger and kosher bacon so I came to taste the weird combination of vegan cheese with bacon which is basically lamb breast in crispy and tender strips. The dish: x-Double Bacon Cheeseburger (220 grams total 2 burgers of 110 for 65 NIS) - The medium-sized burger looks super juicy with melted cheese between the two patties with lamb breast bacon - a soft and low hamburger full of goose juice Soft and delicious with a refined taste of semi-sour and semi-sweet cheese, which blended well with the refined spicy seasoning of the meat, the meat itself was not overly seasoned-the meat seasoning was delicate and good, the cheese blended very interestingly and gave the palate a taste reminiscent of ummi taste. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1136898163116215/",5.0

The problem was when we got a bill, 109 shekels and ninety cents, when I submitted the credit plus ten shekels the waiter tip said, kind of shouted, that it's not a ten percent tip. I am a person who loves to give a tip, gives the messengers extra when it rains and knows how important it is to the waiters and service providers. When the waiter said I did not give a ten percent tip I felt like I had committed a crime and for what? That I did not give another shekel?!? The shame inflicted on me at the restaurant by an act of kindness became a distress in which my fiancée and I, who it was her birthday meal, were trying to figure out where we had gone wrong.

Turns out they have a cheeseburger and kosher bacon so I came to taste the weird combination of vegan cheese with bacon which is basically lamb breast in crispy and tender strips. The dish: x-Double Bacon Cheeseburger (220 grams total 2 burgers of 110 for 65 NIS) - The medium-sized burger looks super juicy with melted cheese between the two patties with lamb breast bacon - a soft and low hamburger full of goose juice Soft and delicious with a refined taste of semi-sour and semi-sweet cheese, which blended well with the refined spicy seasoning of the meat, the meat itself was not overly seasoned-the meat seasoning was delicate and good, the cheese blended very interestingly and gave the palate a taste reminiscent of ummi taste. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1136898163116215/",5.0

Campanella Carbonara Goose Pasta - Once again the feeling of pasta bought the yolk that should have been in the dish was nothing but a small written stain and the rest was protein floating down with the wet. The spicy pepperoni pizza dosage was not right and it just fell apart in my hand. The cocktail the waitress offered us was excellent.

We first asked the person in charge of the shift who served us light bread for all the dishes and after 2 minutes I regretted and asked to replace one of them with focaccia, and I was told it was over, although at the beginning of the order I was asked what bread I was interested in and it was one of the options. Sitting in a restaurant for an hour and seeing many focaccia go out to the tables, and also to those who sat down after me! A very outrageous act, I turned to the waitress and told her could I have been told there was no focaccia and going out to the tables? The waitress was quick to defend the person in charge of the shift by claiming that of course it was over and then came out again and if I wanted a focaccia home, I explained to her that she presented it in a way that was over and would not be again, and of course I did not need a focaccia for the house.

I took a butcher's hamburger (according to the list of selected surgeons) - a medium degree of preparation, it seems that the cook knows how to make a meatball according to the desired size and it is not understood above him. Juicy patty, fresh vegetables that go great. Patty size after frying at a normal size is a sign that the patty is not full of water and that is great.

0,Izzo and Bijou,asaf i.,13.0,01/03/2020,"We have not eaten such food for years 😱. We are not exaggerating. Classic Israeli street food We haven't eaten in years: Kebab in pita / Arais! The truth is, it is not clear why we always avoided. Maybe because of the smoke and smell that is in the fryers that we like less and maybe because we prefer to eat sitting comfortably rather than standing / running. At Izzo and Bijou we had a chance to go back to this popular and delicious food Big Time, minus the frying and the smell (sitting outside) which is a fun bonus. We modeled arais 🥙 that was so soft and pleasant in the mouth (including the pita that is always hard as stone and cuts your palate), a juicy kebab he collected 🧸 eliminated to the end and even a hamburger 🍔 plus corned beef. Ido's clever treatment of the raw materials and meats here and feel it in things that are always neglected for some reason: tahini, ""shawarma"" pickles (which here are instant and the best you will taste) and 🍟en (but huge!)

We were just seated at a high table with rocking chairs on the side of the street, full of people passing by and stuck at the table and everything spilled. It took half an hour for Hanu to ask to come in and the manager just waved at me to say something to the hostess - disgust. After that I talked to a manager again and said that the one who was late an hour ago said we would go inside (while a lot of couples in front of us came in) and he just did not listen, underestimated, and preferred that we take an account and go. It took us half an hour to try to request an account !!!! No waiters no one treats and just disgusting the disrespect of the managers, true it's busy but I pay money for the food and service and if they collide with my desk it makes a lot of sense that they would find us another place to sit.

Upon entering the restaurant there was a feeling that we had entered an ashtray. The area of ​​the covered terrace where smoking is allowed is in no way separated from the restaurant itself, the restaurant is full of smoke and a horrible cigarette smell. We turned to a shift supervisor who did not agree to do anything about it and claimed that these were separate areas even though the distance between them was barely two meters and as stated there is no separation of door or wall. Another appeal to the person in charge also did not help, including a reference to a law that prohibits smoking in public places. The place has signs prohibiting smoking but without the enforcement of those responsible, we got up and left the restaurant and reported to the municipal inspectorate.

Having said that I have to shout that the place is not child / baby friendly .. The baby chair is not suitable for the high tables inside, and outside where there are regular tables everything is a smoking area, the music is a bit noisy so if you build on the babies making a splash it will not happen. From this we took 7 sherry dishes, the dishes were medium plus (the cloud rolls were a show Harris and the pad frozen were a spin but the cauliflower and the caramel salad second presentation were a failure) the dishes did not come out together, it took a long time until we got everything .. .. but when the place does not support small children during the Sabbath, you just want to finish eating and fly away ..

When we verified the fact that there is no chef with the ahmash, she shunned the whole thing in the bottom line, the service was bad and unreliable, we got up and left. If it was not clear - do not go! We asked for gluten free options the staff is clueless and not reliable they have no idea what you can or can not order and when we asked for the chef we were told he was cocking .. when the owner came to talk to us he confessed the was no chef in the restaurant ....
